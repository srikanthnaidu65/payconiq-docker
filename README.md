# Payconiq Assignment - Docker Compose Spring Boot and MySQL

## Build the project
Run the following command to build the project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Run the Spring boot app and MySQL images
Run the Spring boot app and MySQL images with only a single command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Docker will pull the MySQL and Spring Boot images (if our machine does not have it before).

The services can be run on the background with command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Stop the System
Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you need to stop and remove all containers, networks, and all images used by any service in <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file, use the command:
```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all
```
